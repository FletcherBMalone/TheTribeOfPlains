const paragraph = `Of eldern days, ‘fore hands of men with skin of pallor 
took to the Plain,
There dwelt a people, strong and bold, 
upon land so fair and main.

A valiant tribe, who lived aright 
in harmony with earth and trees,
With creatures great, with bison roamed, 
the gifts from spirits seized.

A way of life, from ancestors of yore, 
as creation had done planned.
But fate it was, that one fair day, 
a man with azure eyes made land.

Of foreign tongue, he spake not well, 
but naught his purpose lacked.
He showed his fur, he rubbed his belly, 
and trade in goods he packed.

Thus did they barter, weapons and horse, 
for pelts and pemmican.
And with them came the gift of drink, 
so potent and so thin.

More men arrived, of hue so fair, 
they sought the women's hand.
And with their kin, a people born: 
the “Metis” of the land.

In peace they lived, as friends of old, 
with trade and wealth to show.
And happy were they, till a man came, 
named Selkirk of the low.

"I claim this land, in his great name: 
the King of all the skies.
And you, wild folk, shall give me food, 
or face my army’s rise."

The folk of Plain replied in kind, 
with weapons bright and bold.
And told the settlers to depart, 
lest be repeated Seven Oaks.

But in the White hearts, a hate did burn, 
a fear and distrust so strong.
For in their eyes, the bounty great, 
a land for them to wrong.

When White men once again did come, 
with mightier strength and main.
They settled where the rivers twain 
doth meet upon the Plain.

A man named McDougall did now come, 
to scout the fair domain.
And bade the Metis folk to flee, 
their homes no more to remain.

"This land," quoth he, "is seized, 
by majesty divine.
And ours it is, the noble White, 
no right to thee doth shine."

"Why so?" some asked, and he replied, 
"Her grace the land doth seize,
For noble settlers and the crown, 
her majesty doth please."

The Metis sought a man so wise, 
to help them with their strife,
And found a brave, bilingual guise, 
in whom they placed their life.

The man, both learned and full of wit, 
would protect his kin at any price.
His love for his people surpassed only 
by his piety for Christ.

“My name is Louis Riel,” he spake, 
sternly in his way,
"This land belongs to us, not ye, 
either join us or go away!"

With zeal he raised a noble band, 
and marched to claim the fort.
McDougall fled, Riel crafted a crown, 
and Manitoba was duly born.

But Wolseley came, with might so grand, 
and Riel he had to flee.
The Metis were forced to roam the sparser West, 
where the Assiniboine did sleep.

And still they lived, with nervous hearts, 
and feared that day so near,
When White men would again return, 
and make them disappear. 




Part 2:

'Twas not many moons ere White men again 
the Metis' door did grace.
And West they moved, 
'til all the Plain was settled in White's embrace.

Their lands they took, with brutal hand, 
and insults did they hurl.
Their fate they sealed, with no regard, 
for the Metis' voice and world.

The Metis with naught, did have no choice, 
but to rise and defend.
So they asked Riel, to lend his might, 
as their leader and their friend.

In the year of our Lord, 1884, 
did Riel return.
With friend Gabriel Dumont, skilled in the hunt, 
to arm the Metis' firm.

An ultimatum sent, did Riel present, 
"The Metis shall govern this land."
But the White Canadians did then mobilize, 
to quell the Metis stand.

"Riel," quoth the Governor, 
"Thou commit treason anew,
The Mounted Police, I shall release, 
to arrest thee and thy crew."

"Dumont," say Riel, heart of stone, 
"Thou art leader of my force.
Take 200, brave and skilled, 
and block the Canadian horse."

So Dumont did amass the Metis lads, 
to encamp at Duck Lake's shore.
And on the 26th day, of March's month, 
did the Mounted Police implore.

"Surrender now, ye wild crowd," 
the Constable did shout,
"Tis Only Riel I seek; the rest of you:
to your homes, get out."

"No homes we have," replied Dumont, 
"Taken from us, with disdain,
We shall govern, and no longer suffer,
under our oppressors' chain."

Tensions rose, Police drew their steel, 
and fired upon the rebels.
Several were killed, Dumont's own brother, 
the Metis came unsettled.

"Fire your guns!" Dumont did cry, 
and the Metis answered with might.
A great skirmish then did arise, 
the Metis showing their fight.

"Retreat!" the Constable did cry, 
with a dozen men now killed.
"And return not!" did Dumont reply, 
as the Police fled over the hills.

To Batoche, did Dumont return, 
where the Metis capital stood.
The Metis cheered, for their victory clear, 
and declared their government good.

But in far away Ottawa, in Parliament's halls 
so opulent and grand,
Macdonald did rage, with his fist to the stage, 
as the cabinet quaked in hand.

"What say ye?" Macdonald roared, 
with his fist shaking the air.
And the council of White men, too nervous to stand, 
did no answer dare.

One brave man, with quivering hand, 
did with a glance reply:
"They've declared their own government, in Assiniboia… 
or at least they try."

And Macdonald with ire, did his orders inspire, 
"An army we must raise,
We'll conscript the horse, the cannons import, 
and show the Metis our ways."




Part 3:

This time, however, 
the Metis were not alone in their pain.
For the Indigenous peoples struggled too, 
along the Great Plain.

The British passed a law, 
the Indian Act it was so dubbed.
With intent to extinguish all indigenous culture 
and native blood.

Forced onto reserves, 
children thieved from their parents in the night.
Cree starved, 
bison hunted to the brink by the Whites.

The North-West Mounted Police, 
an iron grip held up the land.
The Cree were robbed, 
and not a single soul lent a helping hand.

In all towns and villages, 
the native peoples were unrighteously oppressed.
Nowhere else Westward to now flee, 
their situation hopeless.

Four great Cree leaders assembled,
 two old and two young.
They sat across the fire from each other, 
deciding what was to be done.

Poundmaker, great peacemaker, 
led his people to flourish.
All bison killed, his tribe starved, 
their children malnourished.

Brave Fine Day, 
young and zealous and loving to fight.
He sought naught but to kill all settlers 
that dare cross his sight.

Wandering Spirit, also young, 
and apt too in displaying his might.
He’d slain many warriors in many duels, 
and wanted the same for the Whites.

Finally the great Big Bear, mystic leader, 
adored by all the tribes.
He’d seen war and sought naught within, 
peace did he prescribe.

The younger chiefs did seek war, 
without heed to lessons past.
But Big Bear and Poundmaker said that 
both boys were too rash.

For they had seen the horrors, 
with great old pasts of strife.
Minds harked back to Belly River, 
where 400 braves lost life.

“Our guns now be much stronger and tall, 
our horses double as fast.”
Fine Day spake with much enthrall, 
“we can repeat Greasy Grass.”

“We may not,” quoth Poundmaker, 
“We have naught but a fraction enough men.
The Whites can bring in thousands, 
we’ll be outnumbered one to ten.”

“It will not be just us,” Wandering Spirit did respond, 
lips bellowing loud.
“For all other tribes will join us too, 
united as one crowd.

“From the Inuk, who with snowshoed feet, 
pinnipeds do chase,
To the Huron, who from mighty falcon beaks, 
warhorns do embrace.

“From the Nez Perce, who freedom shout 
on mountain peaks so high,
To the Mi’kmaq, who first the colonists spied, 
as they did pass by.

“From the Haida, 
grand canoes docked at ancient ports of yore,
To the Blackfoot, 
where bison stomp across the plains that roar.

“From the Mohawk, 
treaties writ with wamp in forests so deep,
To the Squamish in the valleys 
and the swamps of the Cree.

“We are not one people, good chiefs, 
but united in our strife,
And should we rebel, the others shall, 
without doubt, join our fight.”

Big Bear did respond, 
traitor may he be called and toned,
“Against the White man's power, we cannot stand, 
for it is too enthroned.”

Fine Day and Spirit, like 'gators, 
did then shake and snap.
While Spirit shouted and Fine Day cursed 
the powers that do clap.

“So what? To die in battle 
or succumb and die in time?”
“If we keep silent now,” quoth Big Bear, 
“the White man may spare us this crime.”

Fine Day, with great anger, 
“But what if all valley tribes unite?
We could then beat, enforce defeat, 
upon any army of Whites!”

Poundmaker leapt to Big Bear’s aid, 
wary of his own tribe’s danger.
“You mistake, Fine Day, 
that every tribe is led by men of your nature.”

“We do not have to fight,” Big Bear replied, 
“These rivers we shan’t ford.
Most impressive, truly, is the warrior 
who hath not unsheathed his sword.”

“Try peacefully we have before,” 
Fine Day did state with grace
“But weakness, truly, it does implore, 
‘tis time we raise the stakes.”

“Does thou truly love thy people?” 
Big Bear replied once more,
“Why does thou truly seek a fight, for their glory, 
or for yours?”

“Young braves desire just to prove,” 
Poundmaker again came to aid.
“Those who lack a place in the sun 
all claim the world is naught but shade.”

Spirit, senior from Fine Day, 
deeply breathed and dost replied:
“It is true, I seek to honour my ancestors 
by spilling the blood of Whites.”

“But I do feel,” continued he, 
“the only course left we have is to stand.
We must rid ourselves of these settlers 
or face the extinction of our band.”

Big Bear glanced to Poundmaker, 
then at the illumined night sky.
“Sixty years I have been upon this Earth, 
and I have seen so much decline.”

“‘Tis my role to ready this world 
for the next ten generations.
To force this new conflict upon them, 
is to grant them damnation.”

Fine Day and Spirit calmed their faces, 
solemnly looking to the ground.
“Heavy so is the chieftain's head, 
which dares to bear the crown.”

“But,” Big Bear continued, 
“it seems as though all paths lead to this.
The bison are dead, the land is stripped, 
and our people are amiss.

If we do not stand, at least this once, 
our destruction is ensured.
So appear it does, the only option, 
will be to defend our humble herd [hoard].”

Spirit rose and grabbed his rifle, 
“so, it is decided.
I shall fetch the warriors and march on the Whites, 
their lives shall be elided.”

“We leave at dawn,” Big Bear did state,
“but listen to my verse:
We shan’t kill a single settler, 
lest their weapons discharge first.”

The two young war chiefs nodded, 
but deep inside they resented.
They would execute this war as they saw fit, 
even if innocents be tormented.




Part 4:

Big Bear gazed upon the floor, 
where nine White men lay slain.
He looked to where Wandering Spirit 
and his warriors did remain.

"What hast thou wrought?" Big Bear questioned, 
his visage etched with fear.
"Thou hast slain them and taken captives, 
does thou not see danger near?"

Big Bear cast his eyes downward 
as Spirit's band continued to thieve,
"We were to be virtuous folk,  
but now we are driven to reave."

"Summon back thy brigands, 
we shall set them to a nobler use,
For if we don't, how might we be spared 
from the White man’s hanging noose?”

The Cree warriors Big Bear did gather, 
and scolded for their sin,
"When the Whites learn of this savagery, 
we shall have no hope to win."

Wandering Spirit remained silent, 
neither pleased nor regretful.
He clutched the weapon that had taken life, 
his own plan successful.

Big Bear's Cree band had aimed 
to oust the town's fickle Agent,
But instead, the conflict at Frog Lake 
had wrought fatal major.

Big Bear now held resolve, 
he would see this rebellion through.
Violence was already performed, 
and now it would have to do.

Big Bear returned to his camp, 
and ensured the hostages safe.
He then rallied his warband, 
and marched to the nearest fort posthaste.

Upon arrival at Fort Pitt, 
he ordered the militia to surrender.
"Hand over the fort or your lives, 
either one or both you must render."

The militia held no other option, 
outnumbered eleven to one.
“You may keep the fort,” they acquiesced, 
“but you must let us run.”

In Eastern Canada, grave headlines: 
“Savages on the loose!
Whites killed, forts captured, 
the rebels wish nothing of truce!”

The Whites cursed the Indians, 
their anger boiling in ire.
They resolved on one solution: 
"The natives must be annihilated by fire!"

Macdonald called for volunteers, 
the nations most fit and strong.
They gathered in all their town squares 
to join the marching throng.

Canada's modern and potent army, 
General Middleton in command.
"Quell the rebellion," Macdonald decreed, 
"with your military hand."

The Canadians assembled cannons and horse, 
rifles, bombs and sabers.
They boarded trains, canoes and lames 
and marched to pipe and tabor.

Their shakos straight, their eyes with hate 
dark as the thread on their gaiters.
They marched off West in scarlet red 
to face the Metis traitors.

Bayonets, Martini-Henrys, 
and topees of finest pith.
They would not halt, nor stop assault, 
till the Indians were naught but myth.




Part 5:

Twas’ less than a moon's cycle, rails now vital, 
‘fore the Canadian army then drew near.
The Metis did gather in Batoche’s square, 
faces plastered with fear.

A local scout sprinted into the town, 
he called the crowd and yelled:
“The White force, over a thousand strong, 
is less than fifty miles south!

They march to cadence, they hold no patience, 
they will be here by dusk.
Once they arrive, they’ll take our lives, 
leave our town a fiery husk!”

The crowd with fear, the enemy near, 
the Metis knew their day was done.
But Riel stood straight, he mounted a crate, 
and spake three tongues at once:

“Harken to me, brothers and sisters,
for we face a perilous plight.
Our lands are taken, our bison gone,
our children torn from sight.

The settlers have brought destruction,
to all we hold most dear.
Our culture fades, our people starve,
our hearts are filled with fear.

Diseases spread, our hope grows dim,
as we mourn our losses great.
Our only chance for life and limb,
is to seize our solemn fate.

Hear me now, thy great Cree chiefs,
and the peoples of the tribes.
Our homes are wrecked, our lands are theived,
as the police naught but imbibe.

Fear not dear brethren, for we will rise,
and fight for the ashes of our sires.
We shall fight our foes with fierce and noble eyes,
and the faith that our souls so desire.

Whether you fight for Christ and his dear scrolls,
or you fight to see them burned.
Whether you fight for lands and spirits old,
or just so your children may be returned.

Whether you fight for the land that ancestors trod,
or you fight for mothers and wives.
You fight to prove your strength before the gods,
or just so your culture may survive.

No matter why you choose to join us now,
no matter the rhyme or cause.
We must face fearful odds and fight,
to reclaim our rightful sods.

In the snares of death we have been caught
betrayed by spirits, friends, and state.
But dear friends, I know our destiny this is not,
and if it is, we shall battle fate.

So hear me, brothers and sisters,
let us stand together and fight.
For our people, our culture, and our lands,
let us rise up with all our might.

Let us hold our backs to this mighty river,
and our rifles to the hills.
For our peoples and cultures shall never wither,
and history shall be written by our quills.

Grab arms and plant your placards, 
to the heathens, take your aim!
And show those rapacious blackguards 
who are the true leaders of this Plain!”

Hark! A cry of rapture rang, 
a cheer from all those present.
Not one Metis man did not grab arms, 
whether gentry, smith or peasant.

Dumont assembled a force of two hundred, 
to halt the White army’s tide.
For it didn’t matter the force fought five to one, 
they had the spirits on their side.

10 miles to the south of Batoche, 
the Metis crafted mighty defenses.
They held their backs to the great Fish Creek, 
dug into rifle pits and trenches.

They did lack bullets, food and water, 
their jackstock numbered only seven.
But alas a loss at the creek would cost them their speech; 
their morale did pass the heavens.

The Canadians marched, through marsh and moorland, 
‘til Fish Creek did they approach.
Deep into the heart of the Metis nation 
had the Whites now encroached.

Dumont did see the battle coming, 
the circling of the vultures.
But he did see the fate of the creek 
was too the fate of his humble culture.

Tactics were in place, the White shan’t escape, 
surrounded like a buffalo pound.
But it seems the Lord’s hand did hold other plans, 
for the Metis the White scouts found.

Half the force across, 500 strong, 
the Metis realized the White’s folly.
Dumont with 120, though Winchesters plenty, 
did call out “fire the volley!”

From atop the cliffs, the Whites glimpsed into the pits, 
but foliage blocked their view.
The Whites’ bright red vests, their gold aiguillettes, 
shone brightly against the sky blue.

The Metis laid down fire, though their ammunition dire, 
their marksmanship unparalleled.
“We cannot see the rebels,” Middletown did now tremble, 
“Some of those trees must be felled!”

But the White cannons creeped, the cliffside too steep, 
they had not the angle of depression.
So without shelled support, the White army’s hoard 
could not force the Metis’ egression.

But the Metis did splinter, their numbers did dwindle, 
after hours just a skeleton force.
Dumont held the line, with all men he could find, 
but by mid-day had less than a fourth.

The Cree allies had fled, many Metis hurt or dead, 
now outnumbered 500 to 50.
But the Metis held resolve, through the brush they crawled, 
outflanking in a move so risky.

The White militia riled, their corpses did pile, 
Middleton could not rally his shield.
And as dusk did convene, no progress in the ravine, 
the Canadians did flee the field.

Dumont returned to great laud, Batoche’s applause, 
a few dozen men saved the town.
For they had beaten all odds, favoured truly by God, 
and Riel again crafted his crown.

At his camp Middleton pondered, as he filled out his blotter, 
his staff too shocked to speak.
He dispatched Colonel Otter, 
“Take 800 squatters and march on Cut Knife Creek.”




Part 6:

Otter rounded up a militia, 800 men, 
and approached Cut Knife’s Cree hoard.
But Middleton was bemused, his orders confused, 
he had said, “Wait at Battleford.”

Otter carried on, now 400 strong, 
to the Cree camp on Cut Knife’s hill.
His White troops hated the natives, bloodlust unsatiated, 
the men would have their fill.


Poundmaker and his band slept atop the crest, 
Fine Day and his troops covered the camp.
But late into the night, Otter’s men did ford down, 
silent and with naught but one lamp.

Their plan simple: kill the Cree men, 
take the women and loot as they please.
But Fine Day in his den did notice the men 
coming through the marsh and trees.

As the White men now spied, “Alarm!” Fine Day cried, 
the Cree men lept from their lodge.
They would defend their families from the calamity 
and ushered the women to dodge.

The Cree dived into ravines where they couldn’t be seen, 
firing on Otter’s troops.
Otter knew not where to turn, for the foe was obscured, 
his cannons could not then shoot.

Otter’s men became clustered, surrounded like Custer, 
their situation now became dire.
Seeing naught but gunsmoke, Otter’s men had now broke, 
under sustained Cree gunfire.

The Cree warriors did scatter, their bullets did splatter 
from every direction at once.
Otter’s men quickly shattered, his mind did now chatter: 
how could he act such a dunce?

The Cree leapt on horseback, they chased off the White troops, 
determined to ride them down fast.
Fine Day was elated at the plan he created, 
“I did say, we shall repeat Greasy Grass!”

But he shot out in pain as Poundmaker grabbed his reigns, 
“We mustn’t stoop so low.”
If we slaughter the Whites then what travesty 
will surely befall us in tow?”

With great annoyance Fine Day called back his forces, 
“We shan’t chase the troops who take flight.”
And it was this order, thanks to only Poundmaker, 
that three hundred Whites kept their life.

Two great victories, one Cree, one Metis, 
had halted the Canadians’ advance.
But ‘twas less than three weeks after the fight at Fish Creek 
when Batoche was again under attack.

Middletown’s column moved North with cannons and horse, 
one thousand regulars attached.
The Metis knew the Whites’ plan, 
they had to make a stand or else their town be sacked.

Dumont and his men dug into the Earth, 
they turned Batoche into a fort.
The Metis stripped the land before the Whites marched, 
leaving the path well scorched.

But the Canadians did arrive, early on May the ninth, 
dismounting at Middleton’s behest.
Redcoats strewn over the hills, horses crowded the fields, 
gatlings and cannons lined the crests.

The Metis dug into their trenches, obscured by the brush, 
the Whites could see only their Stetsons.
But Middleton’s men didn’t walk, leaving their cannons to talk, 
the Whites had learned their lessons.

The White’s Sniders clicked, their bayonets fixed, they lay behind old crates of whisky.
The Metis held in the glen, outnumbered once again, 
this time one thousand to two fifty.

White and dark troops faced off, two men stood tall, 
a piercing scream rang out, “Riel!
Lay down your arms, surrender your farm, and kneel!” 
Middleton did yell.

Riel did stand, a rifle in hand, 
greeted as he dismounted his horse.
“We meet at last,” he did say as he led his foray, 
and with Middletown spake back and forth.

“Riel, unarm your men and surrender, 
submit before her majesty’s righteous crown!”
“Middleton, I shall not bow before your brazen tiara, 
now march on out of my town.”

“How dare you so complain, when in royal domain, 
your people have all we can provide them!”
“My men have naught to gain by bowing to your reign,
why would we submit to your diadem?”

“Our Anglo-Saxon crown is but humble, 
like the garlands of ancient laurel leaves!”
“How can you call your crown a chaplet, 
when it consists of gems so thieved?”

“Our all-English crown holds such shimmer, 
a luster of incalculable florins!”
“How may it be called ‘all-English,’ 
when its greatest jewels are foreign?”

“Our righteous crown is led by our people superior, 
its regnant appointed by God!”
“How can your mighty Empire be so salient 
when it is ruled by but one soul, so flawed?”

“The crown is not one ruler, 
it flows through a great lineage of lords!”
“Well, I follow, sir, but one fair king, 
and his crown is made of thorns.”

“Riel, thou hast destroyed her royal order,
 you’ve caused chaos in the colony!”
“Tis thou who hast caused chaos, dragging out your army 
and causing such divine comedy.”

“Comedy?! You laugh at her royal army’s proud standards, 
pipes, and drummings?!”
“Oh sir, the Lord laughs at all the wicked, 
for he knows their day is coming.”

“You are a heathen! Your Exovedate, your cult, 
it has made of the lord's word a mock!”
“On the contrary, Mr. Middleton, my fair followers 
have been chosen forth from the flock.”

“Enough! Route now your savage peasants 
‘fore I rain hellfire upon your people!”
“We do not choose to fight thee, good sir, 
tis the rescript of that grace atop the steeple.”

“Don’t you see? Your people shall be driven from this land, 
exiled as the Cochins of Kerala!”
“Then we shall fight and die to the last of our strength, 
like Ali’s great stand at Karbala.”

“I shall slay your men and boys Riel, 
leave your land destroyed as the ruins of Petra!”
“Then we shall fight again as landless lords, 
like the Pandavas of Kurukshetra.”

“My troops will crush your plebeian militia, 
my men will bring upon you a ruinous nakba!”
“Then we shall make your victories pyrrhic, your legions 
destroyed, as Simon of fair Kokhba.”

“Bah! You’re nothing, more savages to conquer, 
another service bar upon my chest to fit!”
“Enough chatter, Middleton. If you want your medal, 
why don’t you come and earn it?”

But Middleton did not quiver, fled behind Earthwork and timber, he ordered his men to load shells.
His lips curved to a simper, his guns turned to unlimber, 
and his cannons began to rain hell.

A great charge of those who opposed them, the Metis could not 
hold them, their trench lines began to yield.
“Hold fast!” Dumont told them, but he could not control them, 
and the Metis began fleeing the field.

The Whites then looted the town, taking all gems for their crown, 
even the church bell they did snag.
Riel emerged from the ground, upon the belfry he draped down 
a most solemn, sheet white flag.




Part 7:

The redcoats rounded up the Metis, making sure none could flee, 
Riel was brought forth and Dumont exiled.
The Whites then pursued the Cree, caught them North on Loon’s creek, and put all the traitors on trial.

“Tis a crime to fight for my fair god?” Riel did query, 
stood upright in the White’s old courtroom.
“You fought not for any lord fair,” the judge did declare, 
“but fear not, you may ask him soon.”

Wandering Spirit and his seven greatest companions 
were all too called traitors in check.
“You eight, for your vile actions driven purely by hate, 
shall all be hanged by the neck.”

Poundmaker and Big Bear, the protectors of their fair people, 
did both in the courtroom appear.
They were sentenced to pay for their transgressions to the White nations, and died within three years.

Fine Day was left with a token, his people were broken, 
the Cree were forced onto reserves.
The Metis were then scattered, the alliance was shattered, 
all “Indians” the Whites then cursed.

The People of the Plains tried to pick up the pieces, 
keep their fair culture preserved.
But it seemed that all the world had done abandoned them, 
even the spirits and Earth.

The culture seeped out, the liquor seeped in, 
the land was stripped barren of roots.
The culture of Plains people began to die out, 
it seemed the White’s plan bore fruit.

The children were taken, the families were shaken, 
the women then began to disappear.
And after a century, they still suffered from Riel’s 
treachery, the message from the colonizers was clear.

But after a time, new voices came to chime, 
a search for justice, for viewpoint, for something greater.
Those in line questioned the Metis’ crime, 
was Riel truly a heathen and a traitor?

All those honourable braves who fought and died 
to save the Plains and the big swamps.
Could they have fought for naught 
but to save their fair families and wigwams?

At 86 years of will, Fine Day did sit upon his hill, 
glancing at the endless plain below.
He spoke with the spirits, the ancestors near him, 
and watched the setting sun's eternal glow.

Their great honour had been relinquished, 
the ancient flame had been extinguished, 
but a speck of light still shone upon the land.
For if any fair kings wished, 
if their honour be so distinguished, 
they may find it within to lend their solemn hand.

For if the Whites contrite graciously, 
and shed the claws of the Papal See, 
maybe their brash policies be dissolved.
And if his royal highness should take a knee, 
or a simple “sorry” did the Cree receive, 
the chief may see the Whites’ sins absolved.

As Fine Day led his last few years, 
a new vision for him did then appear, 
white clouds emblazoned against the bright blue sky.
A symbol of men and women who shall ever unite, 
of the sins of the past under courtly contrite, 
of a passion for peace which shall never die.

A flag of all nations did so unfurl, 
great branches of olives eternally twirled, 
flanking the domain of humankind. 
For under a united, strong and free world, 
the grasping hands of evil shall remain ever curled, 
so long as our fair peoples stay combined.

For our fair globe shall again be impearled, 
the weapons of Revelation shall never be hurled, 
so long as we hold hope in human minds.
For all her paths are peace and plaques are pearl, 
laid upon the altar of the free and the mantle of worlds, 
all peoples equally humanized.

Fine Day saw this great grace, 
a vision that one day, 
all the world shall either harmonize or hang.
But that day was not today, 
for the children were stolen away, 
on their way to their new homes they sang:

“Click-clack, click-clack with the train on the tracks, 
don’t know where we’re going 
but we don’t look back.
Stolen away by men dressed black, 
wrought iron gates 
and a big smokestack.

Fake smiles; rash, silent chortles, 
What is to be gained 
is what only the Lord knows.
We only know we shall not be treated cordial, 
our names are unknown, 
our deeds are immortal.”

But one day a new millenia arose, 
a tried and true “rebirth” of the globe, 
and it brought with it a new wave of penance.
And with heavy head and bowing body, 
an admittance of the heinous folly 
arose from all the commoners and senate.

The blue body had mandated 
the troubled history of natives be waded, 
but it seemed all nations had ignored.
But slowly the peoples awakened, 
they realized themselves their policies were mistaken, 
and for action did they then implore.

It was the people who came united, 
as Fine Day’s spirits had confided, 
who said that the natives shall suffer no more!
They would march for freedom, 
denounce the true heathens, 
they would bring this issue to the courts!

The people gave money they had set aside, 
they denounced the state’s genocide, 
they told the world there would never be a sequel!
“Hear us world: we will reconcile,  
we will join hands across five thousand miles, 
and by God we will make certain we’re all equal!

But this would not happen in Fine Day’s lifetime, 
he knew the true evil men would never answer for their crimes, 
but he was tendered by the future ashore.
For he knew one day the lamps would again be lit, 
one day around the fire great chiefs would sit,     
discussing matters of peace rather than war.

The Plains People would again one day prosper, 
a peace with the Whites would the two peoples foster, 
engulfed in endless green under the suns gaze.
The Plains People and all those upon the Earth 
would one day join hands and return 
to the world they once knew in eldern days.
